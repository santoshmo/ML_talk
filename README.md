# ML_talk

In this talk, we will be going over basic concepts in machine learning and modeling. To illustrate, this repo provides an example of how one might think about basketball data. If you had a fantasy team, how would you determine who the most valuable players are in the NBA? By analyzing data of over 197,000 shots made by players in the 2013-2014 NBA Season, we hope to produce a list of the MVPs of the season. 

Thank you Sai Dharmarajan, shdharma@umich.edu, for the standardized data.
